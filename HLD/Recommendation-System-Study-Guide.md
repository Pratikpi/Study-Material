# Recommendation System (Amazon, Netflix): Interview Study Guide

## 1. Conceptual Overview
A recommendation system suggests items (products, movies, etc.) to users based on their preferences and behavior. Must be accurate, scalable, and fast.

---

## 2. Requirements & Constraints
- Personalized recommendations
- Real-time and batch processing
- Scalability for millions of users/items
- Support for cold start (new users/items)
- Diversity and freshness
- Explainability

## 4. Core Components & Data Flow
- **Activity Log:** Tracks user actions
- **Recommendation Engine:** Computes suggestions
- **Model/Data Store:** Stores models, item/user data
- **Batch Processor:** Updates models periodically

1. User browses items
2. Activity logged
3. Recommendation engine updates suggestions
4. Suggestions shown to user

## 6. Key Algorithms & Data Structures
### Collaborative Filtering
```python
# Simplified collaborative filtering
user_item_matrix = {...}
def recommend(user_id):
    # Find similar users, suggest their liked items
    pass
```

### Content-Based Filtering
- Recommend items similar to those user liked

---

## 7. Scaling, Reliability, and Trade-offs
- **Scalability:** Use distributed processing, partition by user/item
- **Accuracy:** Combine multiple algorithms
- **Cold Start:** Use popularity, content-based for new users/items

---

## 8. Common Interview Questions
- **How to handle cold start?**  
    Use content-based filtering, popularity-based recommendations, or ask users for initial preferences to recommend items when there is little or no user/item history.

- **How to scale for millions of users/items?**  
    Employ distributed systems, sharding, and parallel processing. Use efficient data structures and caching. Leverage cloud infrastructure and batch processing for model updates.

- **How to combine multiple recommendation algorithms?**  
    Use hybrid approaches such as weighted averaging, stacking, or switching between algorithms based on context (e.g., collaborative + content-based filtering).

- **How to ensure diversity and freshness?**  
    Add constraints or re-ranking steps to promote diverse and recently added items. Penalize repeated recommendations and boost new or less popular items.

- **How to explain recommendations?**  
    Provide users with reasons for recommendations (e.g., "Because you watched X" or "Popular among similar users") using interpretable models or post-hoc explanation techniques.

## 9. Real-World Use Cases
- Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube

---

## 10. Tips for Interviews
- Draw architecture and data flow diagrams
- Discuss collaborative/content-based filtering:  
    Be ready to explain how collaborative filtering leverages user-item interactions to find similar users or items, and how content-based filtering recommends items based on item features and user profiles. Know their strengths, weaknesses, and when to use each.

- Mention trade-offs (accuracy, scalability, explainability):  
    Understand the trade-offs between different approaches. For example, collaborative filtering can be accurate but may struggle with cold start and scalability, while content-based methods are more explainable but may lack diversity. Be prepared to discuss how to balance accuracy, scalability, and explainability in your design.
- Walk through recommendation flows
