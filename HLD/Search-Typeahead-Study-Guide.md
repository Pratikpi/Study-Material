# Search Typeahead/Autocomplete: Interview Study Guide

## 1. Conceptual Overview
Typeahead/autocomplete suggests search queries as users type, improving speed and user experience. Must be fast, relevant, and scalable.

---

## 2. Requirements & Constraints
- Suggest top queries as user types
- Real-time response (low latency)
- Update suggestions based on popularity
- Handle millions of queries
- Support personalization

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture Diagram

    User-->|Type Query|Web[Web Server]
    Web-->|Fetch Suggestions|Cache[(Cache)]
    Web-->|Query|DB[(Query DB)]
    Web-->|Update|Stats[Stats Tracker]
```


---

## 4. Core Components & Data Flow
- **Web Server:** Handles user input
- **Cache:** Stores hot suggestions for fast access
- **Query DB:** Stores historical queries, popularity
- **Stats Tracker:** Updates query stats

---

## 5. Example Walkthrough
1. User types "pyth"
2. Web server fetches suggestions from cache
3. If not found, queries DB
4. Suggestions returned: "python", "python tutorial", etc.
5. User selects suggestion; stats updated

---

## 6. Key Algorithms & Data Structures
### Trie for Fast Lookup
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end = False
        self.suggestions = []
```
- Store queries in trie, attach top suggestions at each node

### Ranking Suggestions
- Use frequency/popularity
- Personalize based on user history

---

## 7. Scaling, Reliability, and Trade-offs
- **Scalability:** Partition trie, use distributed cache
- **Reliability:** Replicate data, async updates
- **Latency:** Precompute popular suggestions

---

## 8. Common Interview Questions
- How to store and update suggestions efficiently?
- How to personalize suggestions?
- How to scale for millions of users?
- How to handle new/rare queries?

---

## 9. Real-World Use Cases
- Google Search, YouTube, Amazon, e-commerce sites

---

## 10. Tips for Interviews
- Draw architecture and data flow diagrams
- Discuss trie, cache, ranking
- Mention trade-offs (memory vs speed)
- Walk through query suggestion flows
