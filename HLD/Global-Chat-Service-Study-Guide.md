# Facebook Messenger/WhatsApp (Global Chat Service): Interview Study Guide

## 1. Conceptual Overview
A global chat service enables real-time messaging between users, supporting one-on-one and group chats, media sharing, and notifications. Must be scalable, reliable, and secure.

---

## 2. Requirements & Constraints
- Real-time messaging (text, media)
- One-on-one and group chats
- Message delivery and read receipts
- Offline message storage
- End-to-end encryption
- Push notifications
- Scalability and reliability

## 4. Core Components & Data Flow
- **App Server:** Handles user connections, authentication
- **Message DB:** Stores messages, chat history
- **WebSocket Server:** Enables real-time communication
- **Notification Service:** Sends push notifications
- **Encryption Module:** Secures messages

---

## 5. Example Walkthrough
1. User sends message
2. App server authenticates, encrypts, stores message
3. WebSocket delivers to recipient (if online)
4. If offline, notification sent; message delivered on next login

---

## 6. Key Algorithms & Data Structures
### Real-Time Messaging (WebSocket)
- Persistent connection for instant delivery

### End-to-End Encryption (Simplified)
```python
# Pseudocode for encrypt/decrypt
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
f = Fernet(key)
enc = f.encrypt(b"Hello")
dec = f.decrypt(enc)
```

## 7. Scaling, Reliability, and Trade-offs
- **Scalability:** Partition users, use distributed DB, sharding
- **Reliability:** Replicate messages, retry on failure
- **Security:** Encrypt messages, secure authentication
- **Offline Support:** Store undelivered messages

---

## 8. Common Interview Questions

### How to ensure real-time delivery?
- Use WebSocket connections for persistent, low-latency communication.
- Employ message queues for reliability and retry logic in case of failures.

### How to scale for millions of users?
- Partition users across multiple servers (sharding).
- Use distributed databases and load balancers.
- Employ horizontal scaling for stateless components.

### How to implement end-to-end encryption?
- Encrypt messages on the client before sending.
- Use public/private key pairs for secure key exchange.
- Ensure only sender and recipient can decrypt messages.

### How to handle offline users?
- Store undelivered messages in a database.
- Send push notifications to offline users.
- Deliver messages when the user comes online.

### How to support group chats?
- Maintain group metadata (members, admins) in a database.
- Broadcast messages to all group members.
- Handle group-specific encryption and message delivery logic.

## 9. Real-World Use Cases
- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal

## 10. Tips for Interviews
- Draw architecture and data flow diagrams
- Discuss **WebSocket**: Explain how WebSocket enables persistent, bidirectional connections for real-time message delivery, reducing latency compared to traditional HTTP polling.
- Discuss **encryption**: Describe the importance of end-to-end encryption for user privacy, how messages are encrypted on the client side, and only decrypted by the intended recipient.
- Discuss **offline support**: Outline strategies for handling offline users, such as storing undelivered messages and sending push notifications to ensure message delivery when users reconnect.
- Mention **trade-offs**: Address the balance between low latency (real-time delivery), strong security (encryption overhead), and high reliability (message replication and retries), and how optimizing one may impact the others.
- Walk through message delivery flows
